# Student-Application-Management

Thank you for your interest in my project. Student Application Management (SAM) is a software platform to 
enable educational institutions and their partners to effectively manage the recruitment of both domestic 
and international students. The project was conceived from a combination of my experience working within 
higher education recruitment and from the need to create a functional software solution as part of my 
Master's Degree. Since submitting the original project I continue to spend time adjusting and improving 
the solution as a side project to my professional career.

Version 1.0.1: 

The project is largely in its original version, with online database connectivity and several minor 
modifications and bug fixes being added since the original version (1.0.0). Planned changes and bug fixes
for a future release are currently in progress. 

In order to run the application: 

1. Download the project and import to Eclipse (project created using Eclipse Mars 4.5.1).
2. Navigate to src/com/sam/server
3. Right click Server.java and select Run As > Java Application from the resultant menu
4. A login dialog will now load, enter login details and select login
